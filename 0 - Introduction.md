# Introduction

## What Is Programming?

In short, programming is getting a computer to do what you want. A programmer writes a set of instructions in a programming language and these instructions are then compiled into a program which the computer can execute. This is an important point - programming languages are designed to be read by humans, not by computers. It is the compiled program which is designed to be read by a computer.

Programming almost always involves manipulating some kind of data. It is the job of the programmer to tell the computer how to read the data, what sort of manipulations or calculations to do, and where to send the results. The data can come from the internet, a database, user input (i.e. a form on a website) or many other places.

As you get better at programming you will become more fluent in all the different types of data that exist and how to work with them efficiently. But to do all this we need a programming language to write in...

## What Is F#?

F# is a programming language invented by Microsoft. It is a part of a larger family of technologies called .NET. F# is designed for general purpose programming but it is particularly good for building large, complex applications (which big companies might need, for example) as well as data analysis.

The reasons why F# is suitable for these tasks are beyond the scope of a "learn to code" guide but one reason that is often given is that once an F# program compiles it "just works". Many programming languages allow you to write code which compiles, but doesn't work properly when run. F#, on the other hand, has a very strict compiler which means that it is harder to get code to compile, but once it does you can be confident that it does what you expect.

## Why Not \<insert language here\>?

Let's be clear. F# is not a beginner friendly language. It is designed for experienced programmers to build sophisticated applications. It is not supposed to be easy to work with after 5 minutes of learning. It is, however, supposed to be a joy to work with after many years of programming and software development experience.

That being said, there is no reason why you can't learn to program from scratch in F#, and there is every chance that you will become a far better programmer for it because F# simply does not let you fall back on bad habits like other languages do.

## Where To Go If You're Stuck

Before we get stuck in, it's worth listing a few resources to go to if you're having trouble at any point. Looking up your problem online is a tried and tested solution to any programming problem (until you start trying to solve problems which no one else has thought about yet, then you're on your own!).

The skill is in knowing which terms to search for and which resources are likely to have the answer to your question. Here are a few places you can rely on:

- [fsharp.org](https://fsharp.org/learn.html) has a list of learning resources
- [fsharp for fun and profit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/learning-fsharp/) is _the_ F# blog
- [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/) is the official documentation from Microsoft
- [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/fsharp/index.htm) has another tutorial which is good but not suitable for beginners
- [F# Programming Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/F_Sharp_Programming) is another fantastic reference
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) will almost always have the answer to your question
